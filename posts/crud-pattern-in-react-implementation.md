.. summary: In this post, we will see the implementation details of <em>BookTable</em> and <em>BookForm</em> components. We will explore how to handle field change, field validation, form errors, API errors in <em>BookForm</em> component. We will be using an apiToFormFieldIDs object that holds validation properties for every field. We will also explore how to achieve <strong>Inverse Data Flow</strong> in <em>BookTable</em> by passing data back to parent component Books.


**Recap:** `Books` is a Base component that handles **CRUD** actions and also renders `BookTable` and `BookForm` components. It passes actions and data to the child components. We have introduced it in the previous post that can be found [here](/blog/crud-pattern-in-react-intro/).

# 1. `BookTable` Component

In general, A Table view is used to provide a summary of the data. It can also have an interface (eg. button) to trigger *Update* or *Delete* action on the selected data record. The `BookTable` uses `Table` component to present book entities in a summary view. It triggers *Update* or *Delete* action using `showEditForm` and `performDelete` callback functions, passed as `props` by the `Books` component (parent). It also passes the data required for the actions (book object, book id) back to the parent component.

React supports **Unidirectional/One-Way Data Flow** only. It means, the data is passed from parent to child as `props` which are immutable arguments and not the other way around. Our actions (update, delete) are defined in the `Books` component (parent), but we need the data (selected book id or object) from `BookTable` component (child) to perform the actions. It is not possible to pass data back in *Unidirectional Data Flow*. So how do we *pass back* data from child to parent component? We are able to achieve it by having an **Inverse Data Flow**.

## Inverse Data Flow

- A callback function defined in the parent component is passed as props to the child component.
- The function is invoked by the child component for an event.
- eg. to trigger update or delete action (function invoke) on button click (event).
- The child component can pass data as an argument to the callback function. As the callback function is defined in the parent, the data is made available to the parent for further action.
- As data is passed in the *Inverse* direction (from child to parent), it is called an **Inverse Data Flow**.
- The passed data can then be used by the parent component to call an API action or update the state and re-render the page or any other purpose.


# 2. `BookForm` Component

In general, a form view is used to get user input. Ideally, a form should handle all the internal actions like field value change, field value validation, set field-specific errors and API errors received in the response by itself. The `BookForm` component handles all the mentioned actions by itself. API actions to create and update the book record are passed by the parent `Books` component. We are using an object called `apiToFormFieldIDs` to define validation rules for form fields.

Validation is a very crucial element of any form. If we do not validate the user input, there is a greater possibility for the data to become less reliable. eg. The user may intentionally or unintentionally enter an alphabetical string as 'year'. Such data does not make any sense and is not a valid year. So, we should always make sure form fields are validated against some pre-defined validation rules and the user should be informed about the same.

While working on a professional react project, I have come across various ways to validate a form. Two most common ways among them are,

  1. Validate each field individually once the user has entered data and field is gone out of focus

    The input data is validated against pre-defined validation rules or properties. This way user is informed about the errors (if any) and will be prompted to correct them immediately with `helperText`.

  2. Validate all the fields simultaneously, when the user submits the form

    All the fields are validated against pre-defined validation properties. The user is informed about all field errors at once.

We have used the 2nd way to validate our fields in `BookForm` component. Notice, we are mentioning a *pre-defined validation rules* to validate against, in both ways. So, whichever way we prefer to validate the data, a *pre-defined validation ruleset* is required and is the core part of the custom form validation process. But what exactly the validations rules are? how do we define them? and how exactly can we validate the input against the pre-defined rules?

## Central Place for Form Validation and API Errors Mapping - `apiToFormFieldIDs`

It plays a major role in field-specific custom validations. We define validation rules as field properties like `required`, `key`, `customValidator()` in key-value pair format to validate the field against these validation rules. The main advantage of `apiToFormFieldIDs` object is, we just need to add validation rules as field attributes for each new field in `apiToFormFieldIDs` and field validation will be taken care of by `formValidator()`. Let's see what validation rules are defined for `BookForm`.

  - `key`: We set this to field `id` and the  errors generated during validation are set to the specific field accordingly using field `id`. It not only maps client-side field errors but also the server-side API errors. User will always be informed about both errors (client-side and server-side) this way.
  - `required` - If set `true`, `formValidator()` will generate error if the field is empty. This comes often handy when a given field is required vs optional.
  - `editable` - If set `true`, `formValidator()` will bypass validation for the field altogether. This field is useful when a given property in the object is not allowed to be modified during edit.
  - `customValidator()` - A function to provide field specific validation logic. We can define the field specific logic in following ways:

    1. Entered email field value has valid email format and it contains '@'

    2. Entered `phoneNumber` field value contains numbers only.

    It returns a `formError` object containing `error` and `helperText` properties that is used to map errors to specific field


```javascript
const apiToFormFieldIDs = {
  title: {
    key: "title",
    editable: true,
    required: true,
    customValidator: value =>
      value.length > 100
        ? { helperText: "enter less than 100 characters", error: true }
        : { helperText: "", error: false }
  },
  // Rest of the object entries
}
```

Now, we have seen how to define the validation rules with `apiToFormFieldIDs` object, let's check how field-specific error objects are generated against validation rules by `formValidator()` method for client-side field errors and `apiToErrorsToFormFields()` method for server-side field errors. We will also see how the generated errors are mapped to the specific fields using field `id` by `fieldError()` and `fieldHelperText()` methods.

## Pre-Submit Form Validation - `formValidator()`

It is invoked by `onSubmit` function when the user submits the form. It receives `formData` object containing objects (each having field `id`, `value` as key, value) as a parameter along with `apiToFormFieldIDs` object that contains validation properties for every field. It validates every field against validation properties and generates an error object with `error` (`Boolean`) and `helperText` (`String`) properties. It also receives an error object from `customValidator()`. The error object is then added to `formErrors` object. `formErrors` object is returned along with `errorCount` after all fields are validated.

API call is made only if `formErrors` is empty `(errorCount === 0)` else, errors from `formErrors` are mapped to respective field by `fieldError()` and `fieldHelperText()` functions

```javascript

const formValidator = (apiToFormFieldIDs, userInput, isEditForm) => {
  let formErrors = {};
  for (let field in apiToFormFieldIDs) {
    if (isEditForm && !apiToFormFieldIDs[field].editable) {
      continue;
    }
    let value = userInput[field];

    let fieldEmpty = !value;
    if (fieldEmpty && apiToFormFieldIDs[field].required) {
      formErrors[field] = {
        error: true,
        helperText: "this field should be non-empty"
      };
    } else if (apiToFormFieldIDs[field].customValidator && !fieldEmpty) {
      let customValidator = apiToFormFieldIDs[field].customValidator;
      let formError = customValidator(value);
      if (formError.error) formErrors[field] = formError;
    }
  }

  return { formErrors, errorCount: Object.keys(formErrors).length };
};

export default formValidator;


```

## Server Side Error Reporting - `apiErrorsToFormFields()`

Once the form is validated and all errors are resolved by the user, we submit the form. We are not done yet though. There might be errors on server-side also. Just like formErrors (client-side), server-side errors should also be mapped to the respective field. We use `apiToErrorsToFormFields()` for the exact thing. We receive API response error as props from `Books` component. It is then set in state using `getDerivedStateFromProps()` and used to generate `apiErrors` object.

```javascript

apiErrorsToFormFields = () => {
  const { error } = this.state;
  let apiErrors = {};
  if (error && error.response && error.response.data) {
    let errorData = error.response.data;
    for (let apiKey in errorData) {
      apiErrors[apiKey] = {
        helperText: errorData[apiKey].join(""),
        error: true
      };
    }
  }
  return apiErrors;
};

```

## `formErrors` and `APIErrors`

These objects are generated by `formValidator()` and `apiErrorsToFormFields()` functions respectively. They contain objects with field `id` as key and an object with `error` and `helperText` properties as value. `fieldError()` and `fieldHelperText()` functionsthen use the field `id` to map the `error` and `helperText` properties to respective field.

## Error Reporting Helper Functions - `fieldError()` and `fieldHelperText()`

These functions receive field `id` as parameter. apiErrors are received from `apiErrorsToFormFields()` a new local object named *errors* is created by copying the values of `formErrors` and `apiErrors` using *spread* operator. If the field `id` is present in *errors* object, `error` and `helperText` is set and returned for the field. default values of `error` and `helperText` are `false` and "" respectively.

```javascript

fieldError = id => {
  let apiErrors = this.apiErrorsToFormFields();
  let errors = { ...apiErrors, ...this.state.formErrors };
  let field = errors[id];
  return field ? field.error : false;
};

fieldHelperText = id => {
  let apiErrors = this.apiErrorsToFormFields();
  let errors = { ...apiErrors, ...this.state.formErrors };
  let field = errors[id];
  return field ? field.helperText : "";
};

```

## Collecting Changed Field Values - `onChangeHandler()`

Initially, We had a book form with three input fields `title`, `author` and `isbn`. We created a `handleChange()` function for each field to handle value change like `handleChangeTitle()`, `handleChangeAuthor()` and so on. We decided to add one more field for `year` later on, that caused us to add another function `handleChangeYear()` to handle `year` value change.

For each additional field in the future, we will have to implement additional `handleChangeFoo` function. So for n number of input fields, we will end up implementing n number of `handleChangeFoo` functions. This is not such a good idea and definitely against DRY principle, since all the `handleChange` functions are doing the exact same thing (set field value in the Component State in this case). What if we can achieve the same functionality with a single common handler function?

Since ES6, support for Computed Property Name or Dynamic Object key has been added. Using this feature, we can implement a single `onChangeHandler()` function to handle field value change for any number of fields. We can use the `id` property of the input field as *key* and field value as *value* in `formData` (Create) and `changedFields` (Update) objects of the Component state (eg. `[id]: value => ['title']: value`).

`onChangeHandler()` function follows **Open-Closed (Open for extension, Closed for modification)** principle from **SOLID** principles as no modifications will be required in `onChangeHandler()` for newly added field.

```javascript

onChangeHandler = e => {
  const { id, value } = e .target;
  this.setState({
    ...this.state,
    formData: {
      ...this.state.formData,
      [id]: value
    },
    changedFields: {
      ...this.state.changedFields,
      [id]: value
    }
  });
};


<TextField id="title" onChange={this.onChangeHandler}/>
<TextField id="author" onChange={this.onChangeHandler}/>
<TextField id="isbn" onChange={this.onChangeHandler}/>

// Added later on
<TextField id="year" onChange={this.onChangeHandler}/>

```

This post explored how to achieve ***Inverse Data Flow*** using the `BookTable` component and we also checked different functions, objects used by `BookForm` component to handle field change, field validation, form errors and API errors by itself.

In these two posts, we have explored how we can think of implementing common actions like *CRUD* actions as a pattern, and demonstrated how required supplementary functionality like validating forms, performing API calls etc can be performed. Organizing code like a pattern as described here would in general go a long way in making the code maintainable. (I can say so, by experience :-)).

We will explore more React patterns in future posts. Till then Good Bye!
