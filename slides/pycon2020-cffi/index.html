### What You'll Get out of this talk?

Write Python bindings for your favourite C Library in an afternoon and not in a couple of weeks or months! :-)

<br/>
Get a little more interested in Wireshark and packet dissection!

---
### What we'll look at
 1. A bit of background and how this got started.
 2. `cffi` in Details
  - Choices for writing Python bindings
  - Three stages  of working with `cffi` - `dev`, `deploy` and `runtime`.
  - `cffi` Some more practical advice.
 5. Demo (Time Permitting)
 6. Questions - Mostly offline.
---
### Background


Someone approached me for dumping packets in Elastic Search for being able to do 'analytics' on them.
--
Why not

```shell
tshark -T json ...... | curl -X POST ....

```
or

Elastic's - PacketBeat?
--

What you really need is - Wireshark's Dissectors in Python World.

--

What is a dissector and packet dissection?

### Choices for writing Python Bindings

1. Ctypes
2. `cffi`
3. `SWIG`
4. `Cython`
4. Classic Python API (doing all heavy-lifting)
--
What is `cffi`?

C Foreign Functions Interface
--
Why `cffi` ?
From [`cffi` Goals](https://cffi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/goals.html)

> The goal is to call C code from Python without learning a 3rd language: existing alternatives require users to learn domain specific language (Cython, SWIG) or API (ctypes). The CFFI design requires users to know only C and Python, minimizing the extra bits of API that need to be learned.
--
A Disclaimer:

We'll be seeing a lot of examples/code from `wishpy`!
---
### `cffi` Features Overview
- Application Binary Interface (like `ctypes.cdll`)
- Application Programming Interface (API)
--
You define something called as C definitions for Python Bindings
--
These include the 'types' and 'functions' from the underlying C library
--
Use `cffi` APIs to generate the 'source' file, that will compile into a Python module.
---
### `cffi` Practical Advice

Three Stages -

1. development stage
2. build/packaging stage
3. runtime stage.

---

### Development Stage

Choose the Library's APIs that you need and want to be part of your bindings.

Notes:
In the development stage, one determines which underlying APIs to expose through our bindings
It's not necessary to wrap everything and expose those APIs from the libraries

--

Define `cdef`s - Which means 'C definitions' for your bindings.

Notes: These definitions are usually picked up from the header files of the library that
we are preparing bindings for. Good old Ctrl-C/Ctrl-V is your friend here.
--

A little bit about C - Libraries -

1. A 'C' Libraries header file is it's API essentially. But there are really two parts
   to the API,
   * `struct`s, `const`s, `typedef`s, `define`s etc
   * functions

2. Split `cdef`s into two - `types_cdef` and `funcs_cdef`

For example let's say you are preparing `cdef`s from a file called `spam/foo.h`
where, `spam` is the top level of your library's include files.
--
```c
// Contents of "spam/foo.h"

#ifndef __SPAM_FOO_H
#define __SPAM_FOO_H

const int bar = 42;

void spam_all();


#endif // __SPAM_FOO_H

```

--
One can define two `cdef`s as follows -

```python
spam_foo_h_types_cdef = """
const int bar = 42;
"""

spam_foo_h_func_cdef = """
void spam_all();
"""
```

--
and then use it as follows -

```python

from cffi import FFI

wrapper_ffi = FFI()

wrapper_ffi.cdef(spam_foo_h_types_cdef)
wrapper_ffi.cdef(spam_foo_h_funcs_cdef)

....

```
--

Advantage:

1. Helps to avoid leaking unwanted definitions.
2. Readability of your `cdef` code is improved a lot.
3. For really big libraries - easy to re-organize the `cdef` as above.

--
`cffi` provides two APIs to 'compile' - `verify` / `set_source`

Both do similar jobs -

Use your `cdef`s to generate a `.c` file with boiler-plate code and compile.

--

Once you've defined `cdef`s -

Next step is to `verify` or `set_source` to compile.

*ie* the `cdef`s build on your machine. (Note: requires dev tools.)

--
1. Use `verify` to quickly try out stuff (in fact it may be depricated), but `set_source` when building, distributing.
2. Typically, have a separate `wrapper_builder` module that you use in your `setup.py`
3. Also, define `__main__` where you can `verify` your FFI bindings.

--
Example:

```python
# Code from wishpy/libpcap/src/pcap_builder.py
# Run it as `python -m wishpy.libpcap.src.pcap_builder`

from wishpy.libpcap.src.pcap import (
        libpcap_ffi, _sources, _extra_link_args, _extra_compile_args)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    libpcap_lib = libpcap_ffi.verify(_sources,
            extra_link_args=_extra_link_args,
            extra_compile_args=_extra_compile_args)

    print(libpcap_lib)

		# You can use library's API now as say -
		libpcap_lib.pcap_open(...)
```
--
So if this works, we are ready for next stage - 'build/distribution' -

--

Also, start small, so if your wrapped library has a function like say `print_version`, just do enough to make sure that you can get that working in Python first.

Do this using `verify` above.

Subsequently it just becomes adding more functions and types! :-)

---
### Build/Distribution Stage

This is essentially about how the bindings will work on a computer other than the one where they were developed. :-)

1. Use `src` and `lib` as separate directories (so this is consistent with mental model of C src/lib)
2. `src` are packaged as `sdist`.
3. Use the `wrapper_builder` as defined above in your `setup.py`

`cffi` defines additional params to `setup` function called `cffi_modules`. The `wrapper_builder` module discussed above is included here.


--
```python

# Stuff in your `setup.py` (From `wishpy/setup.py`)

setup(name='wishpy',
				...
        setup_requires=['cffi>=1.14.0'],
        install_requires=['cffi>=1.14.0'],
        cffi_modules=[
            epan_ffi_module,
            libpcap_ffi_module
            ],
        packages=find_packages(),
				...
```

---
### Runtime stage

This is the stage, where actual users of your bindings will work with your bindings.

Often that user is you! :-) (Perhaps only you!)

--

### Providing your own API

1. You should make your own API that wraps the library underneath.

--

2. But also make original API available to someone who just wants that! :-)

--

3. Your API should 'think in Python' and not 'think in wrapped library'. (Often the wrapped library's API can be terrible and you want to hide the ugly parts from your users! :-) ).

--

4. For users of your library, often wrapped library is just a detail.

Notes:
They don't even have to worry about (as long as `pip install your_awesome_wrapper` works)

--
Example:

1. `wishpy` wraps `libpcap` and `wireshark` C libraries in Python.
2. While the bindings are available as it is - if a user chooses,
3. We define our own API - Which are more Pythonic
   * `Capturer` - for capturing live packets from network device
   * `Dissector` - for dissecting packets
4. Users should generally need to know only about the APIs we provide.

--
### Supporting multiple versions of library

One advantage of defining your own APIs is - you can wrap multiple versions of 'C' libraries under your APIs and provide consistent interface to the users.

Here the separation above into `src` and `lib` becomes quite handy -

* `src` is used to build bindings on the target machine.
  - `src` directory has per version `cdef`s and `builder` modules.
* `lib` can wrap your own API along with the wrappers for the 'C' library.

--

Generally -

1. define `api.py` (or a more descriptive module name) for your APIs.
2. and `_wrapper.py` for the wrapped library and details of managing multiple versions of library etc. are handled here.
3. One advantage is - tomorrow if a better library comes and you already have enough users, you can still replace the underlying 'wrapped' libraries.

---
### Not So FAQs

- Keeping in mind about the GC and making sure your objects remain in scope (`cffi` has a pretty good documentation about it.)
--
Example:

```python

def my_func():
	val = ffi.new('char *')
	# do stuff..

class C:
	...

	def call_my_func(self):
		self._val = ffi.new('char *')
		my_func(self._val)
	...
```
--
- Copying Data to/from C types. `ffi.memmove`

--

- All 'C' calls are made by releasing GIL (As some calls can potentially block!)

- Don't muck around with APIs from `Python.h`

--
```c

// Generated code looks like - (Taken from `wishpy`)

...
  Py_BEGIN_ALLOW_THREADS
  _cffi_restore_errno();
  { result = pcap_tstamp_type_name_to_val(x0); }
  _cffi_save_errno();
  Py_END_ALLOW_THREADS
...
```
--

- Callbacks

  * Possible to use Python functions as callbacks.
	* `cffi` documentation is pretty good about this.
--

- For calls in Fast Paths, dereference at the class / object

--
```Python

class C:

	def fast_path(..):
		wrapped_lib.freq_called_func(...)

```
--
Better to

```Python

class C:

	wrapped_lib_freq_called_func = wrapped_lib.freq_called_func

	def fast_path(..):
		cls.wrapped_lib_freq_called_func(...)
```

--
But always **profile first!** - before optimizations like this.

---

A Word about performance:

1. The specific problem is really a sweet spot for `PyPy`.
2. Something that needs to run fast but does not involve `numpy` arrays.
3. I have seen performance - **5 times** faster than `CPython`.
4. In fact we'll see - for this particular run, this beats `tshark` written in C.

---
### Demo (optional)

Now we'll look at a quick demo of something that works. A simple example -

- Wishpy and Elastic/Kibana
- Performance demo with `PyPy`
