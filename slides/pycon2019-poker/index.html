### Overview Of the talk
 1. Why this Problem?
 1. An introduction to Game of Poker <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
 2. Types of Poker Hands and Ranking them <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
 3. Simulating a Poker Game <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
 4. Statistics of a large number of games. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
---
### Why This Problem?


This is a good candidate for demonstrating how to 'Think In Python'.

--
Thinking in a language is about built-ins, core constructs and standard library.
--
Ranking Poker hands becomes quite a challenging problem, without `set` like abstraction.

---
### Game of Poker - Quick Intro

There are many variations of Poker games, we'll look at the most common variant called Texas hold'em.

Poker is a card game involving multiple players -

1. Each player is dealt two cards initially.
2. Then there are cards called community cards, a total of 5 Community cards are available to all players.
--

3. Those cards are revealed as follows -
  - Three community cards are revealed first (called 'flop')
  - Then one more community card is revealed (called 'turn')
  - Finally, last community card is revealed (called 'river')
4. At each of the above rounds, players bet, in a round-robin manner.
5. Another player can 'Call' a player's bet or 'Raise' a player's bet or 'Fold'.
6. At each stage, all players' bets should be equal.
7. Player with highest bet or the best hand wins.

---
### Poker Hands - Overview

1. Each Poker hand is made up of 5 cards.
2. Using any combination of Player's own cards or community cards (most variations differ in this aspect)
3. The hands are ranked based on their odds, one with lower odds is ranked higher

### Okay Some Python now!

We'll first start with representing a card, a deck and hands.
--
### Representing Cards

Ideas borrowed from [Peter Norvig's code](http://norvig.com)

 * Each Card has got a 'Rank' and a 'Suite'.
 * Ranks from 1 (for Ace) to 13 for (King) but actually we use 2 to 14 (for Ace)
 * Suits are Spade, Heart, Diamond, Club.
 * Thus we can represent a card as Rank+Suite - '2S', 'AD' , 'QC' etc.
 * Also, for every 'Rank', we'll assign a value (some notion of Score of that card).

--
### Card Deck

Thus our Deck now will look like -

```python
suits = ['S', 'H', 'C', 'D']
cardranks = {'2':2, '3':3, '4':4, '5':5, '6':6, '7':7, '8':8,
        '9': 9, 'T': 10, 'J':11, 'Q':12, 'K': 13, 'A': 14}


def deck(shuffled=False):
    d =  [''.join((rank, suit)) for suit in suits \
            for rank in cardranks]
    if shuffled:
        random.shuffle(d)
    return d


```
--
### Poker Hands

Poker Hands are just - A list of 5 cards - Some Examples

```python
# Flush (All Spades)
flush = ['AS', 'JS', '9S', '6S', '2S']

# Full House (2 Aces and 3 Kings)
full_house = ['AS', 'AD', 'KC', 'KD', 'KH']

# High Card (Ace High)
high_card = ['AS', 'QC', '9D', '7C', '4H']

```
---
### Comparing Poker Hands

We'll start by defining a class called 'PokerHand' and then use operator overloading for comparison.

Strictly, there's no need to 'force' to use a class here, but this comes in handy when we simulate a game.

--
```python
class BasePokerHand:

    ...
    def __init__(self):
        """ ranks, suits as separate lists from the cards.
          ordered, is a list of (rank, count) tuples,
          useful in tie-breaker.
        """
        self._cards = None,
        self._suits = None,
        self._ranks = None,
        self._ordered = []
    ...
```
--

We'll need to determine the 'type' of a hand.

Some ways in which we can determine 'type' of a hand -

1. If All the cards are of same suite, it's a flush, this we can represent in python as
```python
len(set(suits)) == 1
```
2. '4 Of a Kind' and 'Full House' will have at the most 2 ranks (4A-1K or 3A-2K)
```python
len(set(ranks)) == 2
```
--
3. If it's a 'Straight' difference between max rank and minimum rank is 4
```python
max(ranks) - min(ranks) == 4
```
--
```python
class PokerHand(BasePokerHand):
  ...
    def flush(self):
        return len(set(self._suits)) == 1

    def straight(self):

        return len(set(self._ranks)) == 5 and \
                max(self._ranks) - min(self._ranks) == 4 or \
                (len(set(self._ranks)) == 5 and \
                    max(self._ranks) == 14 and \
                    sum(self._ranks) == 28)

    def straight_flush(self):
        return self.flush() and self.straight()

    ...
```
--
```python
    ...
    def four_of_a_kind(self):
        return len(set(self._ranks)) == 2 and \
                self.ordered[0][1] == 4

    def full_house(self):
        return len(set(self._ranks)) == 2 and \
                self.ordered[0][1] == 3 and \
                self.ordered[1][1] == 2

    def three_of_a_kind(self):
        return len(set(self._ranks)) == 3 and \
                self.ordered[0][1] == 3

    ...
```
--
```python
    ...
    def two_pairs(self):
        return len(set(self._ranks)) == 3 and \
               self.ordered[0][1] == 2

    def pair(self):
        return len(set(self._ranks)) == 4

    ...
```
--

Once we find out the type of a hand, we'll find the score of a hand and then compare the hands using their scores.

```python
    def score(self):
        score = 1 << 0
        if self.four_of_a_kind(): score <<= 7
        if self.full_house(): score <<= 6
        if self.flush(): score <<= 5
        if self.straight(): score <<= 4
        if self.three_of_a_kind(): score <<= 3
        if self.two_pairs(): score <<= 2
        if self.pair(): score <<= 1

        return score

```
--
But we also need to break ties when scores are same, where this `ordered` comes into play.
Closer look at 'Ordered'

`ordered` is a list of tuples of the type (rank, count) sorted, by count first and rank later.

```python
    def ordered(self):
        if self._ordered:
            return self._ordered

        rank_counts = list(set([(i, self._ranks.count(i)) \
                for i in self._ranks]))
        return sorted(rank_counts, key=itemgetter(1, 0),
                reverse=True)
```
--
This Serves as a tie-breaker. Let's take some examples -

```python
1. 'HA', 'SA', 'S8', 'C8', 'H8'  - # ordered = [(8,3), (14,2)]
2. 'HA', 'SA', 'CA', 'S6', 'H6'  - # ordered = [(14,3), (6,2)]
```
Thus hand 2 is better than hand one, even though both are 'full house' hands.
(Trivia: Both hands above are from the movie 'Casino Royale')
--
Finally the comparison operator
```python
    def __lt__(self, other):
        if self.score < other.score: return True
        if self.score > other.score: return False

        for a, b in zip(self.ordered, other.ordered):
            if a[0] < b[0]:
                return True
            if a[0] > b[0]:
                return False

```
--
So far we have looked at comparing Poker hands, now we will look at simulating Poker Games.

---
### Simulating a Single Poker Game

1. A poker game consists of a Table, with given number of Players
2. Then there are different actions, initial two cards, we call a 'deal'
3. Then there are other actions like 'flop', 'turn', 'river' as new
   cards are revealed.
--

1. To simulate a Poker Game, we need -
   - Shuffled Deck
   - Number of Players
   - Each Player's initial hand (we call it `MiniPokerHand`)
   - And actions like 'flop', 'turn', 'river'
2. We'll start with a class called `PokerTable` (actually it can be better called
	 as `PokerGame`.)
3. We are going to look at some built-ins and standard library modules
   - `sorted` built-in and how to use custom functions to rank
   - `itertools` modules and `combinations` generator
--

We keep some additional state for a game, this state includes

1. Which player had the best hand during initial 'deal'
2. Which player had the best hand after 'flop', 'turn' respectively
3. Which player had the best hand
4. Also, things like, how many 'pairs' were there in initial deals or Ace Highs or Cards of Same suite.

This state will be useful when we run simulations and want to find out answers
--
As we see there are different stages of a game (at each stage, players on the table Bet)

At each stage, we need to Rank Players. Let's look at how it's done
--
```python
def rank_players(self, pre_flop=False):

    player_hands = {}
    if pre_flop:

        for i, player in enumerate(self._players):
            player_hands[i] = MiniPokerHand.from_str( \
                    " ".join(player.own_cards))
            if max(player_hands[i].ranks) == 14:
                self._ace_high_players.append(i)
            if player_hands[i].score == 2:
                self._pair_players.append(i)
            if len(set(player_hands[i].suits)) == 1:
                self._mini_flush_players.append(i)
    ...
```
--
```python
    ...
    else:
        for i, player in enumerate(self._players):
            possible_hands = []
            for c in combinations(self._community_cards, 3):
                hand = player.own_cards + list(c)
                possible_hands.append(PokerHand.from_str(\
                        " ".join(hand)))
            player_hands[i] = sorted(possible_hands,
                    reverse=True)[0]

    players = (sorted(player_hands.items(),
        key=lambda kv:kv[1], reverse=True))

    for i in range(len(players)):
        player_id = players[i][0]
        self._table_ranks[i] = player_id

```
--
So a single game would look like -
```python
    def run_one_game(self):

        self.deal()
        self.rank_players(pre_flop=True)
        self._deal_winner = self._table_ranks[0]

        self.burn_card()
        self.flop()
        self.rank_players()
        self._flop_winner = self._table_ranks[0]
...
```
--
```
...
        self.burn_card()
        self.turn()
        self.rank_players()
        self._turn_winner = self._table_ranks[0]

        self.burn_card()
        self.river()
        self.rank_players()
        self._river_winner = self._table_ranks[0]

        self._game_winner = self._river_winner
```
---
### Simulating a large number of games

1. We are interested in finding out whether there are any interesting statistics in Poker
2. We just need a driver for the above code.
--
### Some results from simulations

Can we develop statistics from looking at simulations of a large number of games?

Are they a function of number of players?

### Simulation results discussions

Actually interesting statistics are conditional probabilities above -

1. Flush during initial deal is a winner both in absolute and conditional terms.
2. Pair winners appear to be half that of Ace high winners in absolute terms,
3. However, if we look at conditional probabilities, they appear to be comparable.

--
The above statistics can be used along with other table level statistics, like -
1. Is Flop winner the final winner?
2. Is Turn winner the final winner?

--

Some interesting observations -

1. The statistics don't appear to change as per number of players in the table (A bit counter intuitive)
2. Conditional probabilities tell, given you have a type of hand during deal, what are your odds of winning a hand

--

Some thoughts on how these stats can be used -

1. You can determine strategies, where at each stage, you can determine - what's a risk involved while placing bets?
2. You can refine that as game progresses - Bayesian thinking (Initial Mini Flush, Possible Flop Winner etc.)
